  Oops Stands for "Object Oriented Programming System"
  
  "Object oriented programming system is a programming system that is associated with the concept of
  Class, Objects and various other concepts revolving around these two,like inheritance , polymorphism ,abstraction,
  encapsulation etc."
  
  Class --> A class is defined as a blueprint /structure from which we can create individual object,
  class does not consume any space

  object --> Object is a real time entity.When an object is created , the class is said to be instantiated.
  --All the instances share state/attribute and behaviour .both are unique for each object
 
    
  state --> it reflects properties of object
   
  behavior ---> reflects response of an object with other object 
   
  Identity -->It gives unique name to an object & enables one object to interact with other object
  
  Identity-->DOG
  State--> Breed ,Color,Age
  Behavior-->bark,sleep,wagging
   
   
 Method -->Initial of methodName should be lowercase ...cannot create method inside method... A method is collection of
 statement 	that are grouped together to perform an operation
 
Method is set of code which is referred by name & can be called at any point in a program
Simply by using methodname
   
    syntax-->
    
  
   modifier/ specifier							returntype						methodName(parameter list)
  
   {
   	method body
   }
   
  modifier/specifier -->	The access type to use[public,private,protected,private]
  returntype ---> the type of value returned by method
  methodName ---> name of Method
  Parameter list ---> datatype , number of parameter/argument
